      'Developed a real-time chat application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and Socket.io, enabling instant messaging and bi-directional communication. The project involved creating custom React hooks to manage component logic effectively. Authentication is managed through JWT and global state management with the Context API to ensure a seamless user experience across the application.',

    name: 'JOBIFY',
    content:
      'Developed a MERN stack project featuring job search functionality with React Query, an admin panel, and an image upload feature using Cloudinary. The backend is enhanced with express-async-errors for error handling, and multer for handling image file uploads, helmet and express-mongo-sanitize for security of the web application. Authentication is managed through cookies, providing a secure and seamless user experience.',

    name: 'comfy-store',
    content:
      'Developed a React-based frontend application for a store that allows users to add products to a cart and proceed to checkout. Also implemented search and filter functionality in the FE so that the products can be filtered based on their name,category, company,price range,etc. The application utilizes React Query for data fetching from a pre-made backend API and manages state using Redux Toolkit. It also includes pagination functionality to enhance the user experience while browsing products.',

    name: 'medium-blog',
    content:
      'Developed a Medium-like blog application using React and TypeScript for the frontend and Hono for the backend, which is hosted on Cloudflare Workers. It leverages Postgresql as the SQL database(relational DB) and Prisma as the ORM. Additionally, I created a common module containing shared functions, published it as an npm package, and integrated it into both the frontend and backend by installing the module from npm. This modular approach ensures consistency and reusability across the application. It shows how would we achieve Monorepo structure using npm.',

      'Developed a Paytm-like application that allows users to transfer money between accounts. The frontend is built with React, utilizing React Router DOM for seamless routing. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, with express-async-errors handling error management. The application employs JWT for secure authentication, and MongoDB serves as the NoSQL (schemaless) database, with Mongoose used as the ORM for managing database operations.',
